# MotionMetrics
Sports Biomechanics System
A multi-camera sports biomechanics analysis system designed to capture and reconstruct athletic movements in 3D with high accuracy using computer vision with synchronized, calibrated video feeds. The system leverages marker-based joint tracking for analyzing dynamic poses such as jumps and gaze direction, enabling precise motion analysis. It facilitates session-wise athlete tracking, pose reconstruction, and visualization through an interactive desktop interface for performance monitoring and biomechanical evaluation.
